// Double Pointer

/*
You are given two integer variables: n1 and n2.

Task:

- Initially, a pointer points to n1.
- Pass the address of this pointer (int **pp) to a function.
- Inside the function, decide:
- If the value at pointer is even, reassign it to point to n2.
- If the value is odd, keep pointing to n1.
- Finally, print the value where pointer points.

Example-1:
Input: n1 = 10, n2 = 50
Output: 50
(10 is even ➔ reassign to n2)

Example-2:
Input: n1 = 7, n2 = 100
Output: 7
(7 is odd ➔ keep pointing to n1)

Example-3
Input: n1 = 22, n2 = 88
Output: 8
(22 is even ➔ reassign to n2)
