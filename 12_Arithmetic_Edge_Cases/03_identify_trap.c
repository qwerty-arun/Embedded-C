// Identify Trap in Signed vs Unsigned Comparision

/*
You are given two variables:
- A signed 8-bit integer int8_t a
- An unsigned 8-bit integer uint8_t b

Your task is to:
- Compare them using if (a < b)
- Return 1 if the condition is true, else 0

You must understand and handle the signed-to-unsigned promotion trap. Use your own logic to make the comparison accurate as per actual numeric intent.

Example-1
Input: a = -1, b = 1
Output: 1
(Since -1 is less than 1)

Example-2
Input: a = 250, b = 240
Output: 1
(Since a is int_8t, it can hold value -128 to +127 only, so if we assign 250 it will be considered as -6 in decimal)

Example-3
Input: a = -128, b = 255
Output: 1

    int8_t a;
    uint8_t b;
