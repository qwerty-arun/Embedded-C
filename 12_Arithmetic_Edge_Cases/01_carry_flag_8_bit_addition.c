// Carry Flag in 8-bit Addition

/*
You are given two uint8_t numbers — a and b. You have to add them and store in 8-bit variable only. As addition may overflow (>255), you have to 

- Output the sum as it would appear in an 8-bit register (wrapped)
- Output the carry flag (1 if carry occurred, 0 otherwise)

Note: You can use only 8-bit variables. No uint16_t, no casting to larger types

Example-1
Input:  a = 255, b = 1
Output: sum = 0, carry = 1

Example-2
Input:  a = 200, b = 100  
Output: sum = 44, carry = 1
