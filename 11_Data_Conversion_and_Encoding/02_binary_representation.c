// Print Binary Representation for an 8-bit or 16-bit Value

/*
In embedded development, visualizing the binary form of a value is crucial for debugging and understanding register configuration. Your task is to:
- Read an unsigned integer (8-bit or 16-bit)
- Print its binary representation, padded with leading zeros
- Length must be 8 bits (if input ≤ 255) or 16 bits otherwise 

Example-1
Input: val = 10
Output: 00001010

Example-2
Input: val = 255
Output: 11111111

Example-3
Input: val = 1023
Output: 0000001111111111

Example-4
Input: val = 65535
Output: 1111111111111111
